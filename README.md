# Shuttle Signups [<img align="right" width="150px" src="http://webtech.union.rpi.edu/assets/css/images/wtg.png">](http://webtech.union.rpi.edu/)
A web interface to simplify the process of signing up for special shuttles at RPI.

## What exactly is a special shuttle?
The Rensselaer Union, along with support from Auxiliary Services and Parking & Transportation, runs a pilot program for a Capital District shuttle service. Certain weekends of the year, shuttles leave from the Rensselaer Union to destinations around the Capital District such as Crossgates Mall and Albany International Airport.

## Why is this project needed?
Before this project came to exist, a Google Form was used to facilitate sign-ups for these special shuttles. These forms weren't the best solution. This project aims to simplify that process, helping both students, and those at Parking and Transportation.

## Development and Deployment
This project is developed on a modified MEAN stack (MariaDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js).
